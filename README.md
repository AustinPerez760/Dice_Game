# A two-player interatctive game that utulizes semantic HTML elements, DOM manipluation through JS, and class toggling based CSS.

## Be the first of two players to roll a accumulative number over 21 uising a six sided die. However, be careful as rolling a 1 will skip your turn entireley and pass the roll to your opponent.

## Player 1 will always start off the game and the indication of whos turn it is will be reflective by the background color of the player cards. If the background hue is a lighter than the opponents than that player is up to roll!

## If a player presses the "Hold" button their score will be saved until next turn thus avoiding the chance of rolling a 1 within that turn.

## Winner of the game will see a background change to a gold hue and the game is to be reset was the "New Game" button is clicked with both scores starting at 0.

This project served as a personal refresher on basic level semantic, DOM and CSS concepts.
