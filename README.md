# A two-player interatctive game that utulizes semantic HTML elements, DOM manipluation through JS, and class toggling based CSS.  

## Be the first of two players to roll a accumulative number over 21 uising a six sided die. However, be careful as rolling a 1 will skip your turn entireley 
## and pass the roll to your opponent. 

This project served as a personal refresher on basic level semantic, DOM and CSS concepts.
